## ✅ Phase 2: Frontend Foundation - 95% COMPLETE

### React Application Structure

**What's Ready:**
- Complete UI component library (50+ shadcn/ui components)
- Modern stack: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- State management: TanStack Query + React Hook Form configured
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Development tooling: ESLint, Prettier, hot reload

**UI Components Ready:**
- Layout components (Header, Sidebar, Footer)
- Form components with validation
- Progress indicators and loading states
- Error boundaries and toast notifications

---

## ❌ Phase 2: Backend API - 0% IMPLEMENTED

**What Needs to Be Built:**
The backend FastAPI application outlined in `phase2_be.md` needs to be implemented from scratch:

- FastAPI foundation with CORS middleware
- SQLite database with job tracking tables
- Core API endpoints for video processing
- Background task processing using existing CLI modules
- WebSocket endpoint for real-time updates

---

## 📋 Documentation Excellence

- **Implementation Plan** (`docs/phase2_plan.md`): 3-week roadmap with tasks

### Technical Specifications:
- API endpoint designs with schemas
- Database models and migrations
- WebSocket architecture for real-time updates
- Security and performance considerations
- Testing strategies and quality assurance
