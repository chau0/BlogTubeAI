## Component Architecture

### Design Principles

**Component Hierarchy:**
- **Pages**: Route-level components that orchestrate the user experience
- **Features**: Business logic components that handle specific workflows
- **UI Components**: Reusable interface elements with props-based customization
- **Layout Components**: Structural components for consistent page organization

**Component Patterns:**
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Build complex UIs by combining simple components
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Prop Interface Design**: Clear, type-safe interfaces with sensible defaults

## State Management Strategy

### State Categories

**Server State (TanStack Query):**
- Video metadata and validation results
- Job progress and status information
- Provider availability and configuration
- Historical job data and results
- API response caching and synchronization

**Client State (React Hooks):**
- Form input values and validation states
- UI component states (modals, dropdowns)
- Navigation and routing state
- Local user preferences and settings

**URL State (React Router):**
- Current page and route parameters
- Query parameters for filtering and searching
- Navigation history and back button support
- Deep linking to specific application states

### Query Key Strategy

**Hierarchical Query Keys:**
```typescript
const queryKeys = {
  videos: {
    all: ['videos'] as const,
    detail: (id: string) => ['videos', id] as const,
    languages: (id: string) => ['videos', id, 'languages'] as const,
    validation: (url: string) => ['videos', 'validate', url] as const,
  },
  jobs: {
    all: ['jobs'] as const,
    detail: (id: string) => ['jobs', id] as const,
    progress: (id: string) => ['jobs', id, 'progress'] as const,
    history: (filters: JobFilters) => ['jobs', 'history', filters] as const,
  },
  providers: {
    all: ['providers'] as const,
    detail: (name: string) => ['providers', name] as const,
    health: ['providers', 'health'] as const,
  },
} as const;
```
